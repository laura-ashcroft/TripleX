### This game demonstrates:

- Assigning variables as strings to easily reuse certain words/phrases - reducing repetition across the code
- Breaking code down into small, specific functions to clean up the file
- Using std::cout and std::cin to create a dynamic game where the player can input their choices and receive messages
- Using a nested if statement within a for loop to create specific conditions
- Creating a series of if/else if statements to determine if the game has been won or lost
- Increasing the difficulty of the level as the player progresses

## How to use

1. Read the introduction to set the scene of the game.
2. You need to defuse bombs by entering the correct 3 letter code.
3. The 3 letter combination will have both a sum they add up to, and a product they multiply to.
4. You have 3 lives throughout the game to make the correct guesses or the bomb will blow up!
5. Complete level 5 to beat the game and save the bridge!

## Installation
